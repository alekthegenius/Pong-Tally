# PongTally
**An App to Keep Tally of Your Games**

## Description

An open-source, ad-free, scoreboard app that while designed for Ping Pong, can be used to keep tally on any game. Equipped with voice-recognition, extensive color themes, game settings, and a simplistic user interface, PongTally is made for you, the consumer, in mind.

## Inspiration

Ok, now with all of that marketing jargon out of the way, let me talk about why I made it. Throughout my many years of playing ping-pong its always been a struggle for myself and others to remember scores during an intense match. And so started the quest of searching on the App Store for a simple app to keep score. However I was shocked to not be able to find one, with most having ads, a clunky UI, and no hands-free mode. So with nothing on the App Store that fit my needs, I decided to my own instead. Thus PongTally was born.

## Roadmap

 - [x] Make Customizable UI
 - [x] Program Game Logic
 - [X] Create Voice-Recognition
 - [ ] Finalize and Launch on the App Store
 - [ ] Create Version 2, with a Tournament Mode, with brackets, serve tracker, and game logs.
 - [x] Use `UIApplication.shared.isIdleTimerDisabled = true` to keep phone awake during a game
